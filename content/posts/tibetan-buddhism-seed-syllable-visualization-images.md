These images have been created for the benefit of all beings, may they assist you in your visualization, meditation, and practice.

> Where relevant, translated words are shown with their corresponding Sanskrit (skrt) and Tibetan (tib) ([Wylie transliteration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wylie_transliteration)) equivalents. Italicized words represent the Sanskrit simple English spelling. See the *Reference Sources* section below for works on Buddhist symbology.

## The Seed Syllables

The following figure shows a mosaic of all the seed syllables (skrt: bijas). *Bija* literally translated means "seed", and in the case of sacred syllables, can be taken to mean "mystical symbols and sounds which represent root attributes of the cosmos, manifest and unmanifest". The *bijas* carry with them great power and influence. The Vedic creation myths state that the scripture was "heard" (skrt: sruti), and was later encoded into the Sanskrit language, as such the sound and visual representation connects directly to that ancient power (skrt: apauruseya). When used in meditation, visualization, and sound, the practitioner can connect directly with the primordial nature of each *bija*.

{{< figure src="tibetan-buddhism-bijas-collection.webp" caption="Tibetan Buddhism *bijas* Collection" >}}

The *bijas* are (from top clockwise):

- **A** (tib: a)
- **AH** (tib: AH)
- **OM** (tib: oM)
- **HUM** (tib: hU~M) x2
- **TAM** (tib: tAM)

## Hidden Symbology

While researching this project, it was fascinating to learn more about the hidden symbolism which appears in Buddhist imagery, specifically Tibetan Vajrayana and Dzogchen (tib: rdzogs chen) in particular. While the images in this collection appear simple in their design, they are expressing **ancient esoteric teachings encoded into symbols**.

For the images of this collection, two core teachings were used to encode the symbols: Annutara Yoga Mother class Tantra (Vajrayogini, left-hand tantra), and Ati Yoga Dzogchen's second *Rigpa* (skrt: vidya, tib: rig pa) wisdom *lhun grub*.

Working from the outermost symbol inwards, we have:

**Rays of Light**: Rays of light emanate from the center-point on a background of royal-blue sky.

**Five Spherical Rings**: On an *exoteric* level the rainbow-like rings represent the five elements (skrt: pancha bhuta, tib: 'byung ba lnga) as described in Vajrayana:

- Ether, Space (*Vyoma*, *Akasa*): White, Vairochana, KHAM
- Air (*Vayu*): Green, Amitabha, YAM
- Fire (*Agni*): Red, Akshobhya, RAM
- Water (*Varuna*): Blue, Ratnasambhava, VAM
- Earth (*Prithivi*, or *Bhumi*): Yellow, Amoghasiddhi, LAM

On an *esoteric* level the rings have a vast interpretation that can consume a lifetime (or more) of study.

Annutara Yoga: To understand the way in which the female tantra is symbolized in the images, we must first consider the Five (skrt: pancha) Jina Buddha Mandala. This mandala is one of the primary formulations of the bliss-body (skrt: sambhoga kaya), and a way to conceptualize Buddhahood in meditation and art.

{{< figure src="tibetan-buddhism-pancha-jina-buddha-mandala.webp" caption="Pancha Bija and Jina Buddha Mandalas" attr="John C. Huntington" attrlink="https://huntingtonarchive.org/" >}}

In the male tantras, this mandala is visualized *clockwise* beginning from the eastern direction (bottom in the mandala). Directionally, this would be East (Blue, Bottom, Akshobhya) -> South (Yellow, Left, Ratnasambhava) -> West (Red, Top, Amitabha) -> North (Green, Amoghasiddhi) -> Zenith (White, Center, Vairochana). However, in the female tantras the eastern and zenith position are switched and one visualizes in a *counter-clockwise* direction beginning at the zenith, hence the name "left-hand".

Encoding: the female tantra version of the Pancha Jina Buddha Mandala as an "inner-offering".

> It's important to note (and visualize) the colors starting inside with blue and working *counter-clockwise* outwards to white. We are beginning at the zenith, at emptiness.

Switching motifs to Dzogchen and the second *Rigpa* wisdom *lhun grub*, the rings take on another level of meaning which builds upon the previous mandala. The *lhun grub* teachings state that the "rainbow body" (tib: 'ja' lus) is a level of realization, or full enlightenment and the self-liberation of the human body into a non-material body of light. The "rainbow body phenomenon" is the third party observation (spheres of rainbow light) of the moment when a practitioner attains the rainbow body (*sambhoga kaya*) at death.[^1] In Dzogchen this concept (*lhun grub*) is symbolized as a set of spherical rings called *thigle* (tib: thig le).

[^1]: [Rainbow body](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_body).

Encoding: *thigle*, the rainbow body, and spheres of rainbow light.

**Vajra Midpoint**, **Bindu**, and **Emptiness**: The *vajra* (tib: rdo rje) is a symbol, like the rings, which can consume an entire lifetime (or more) of study. Focusing on Tibetan Buddhism and the esoteric viewpoint, the *vajra* is a symbol of an adamantine state of existence and embodies emptiness (skrt: shunyata). The center of the *vajra* represents the Null state, where *Samsara* emerges, regenerates, and disintegrates. On one side of the *vajra* is Phenomena, and on the other is Noumena.

The Sanskrit teachings around the word *bindu*, the point or dot at which creation begins, and the starting place of the mandala, is another way to approach this metaphysical imagery. 

Encoding: the central burst of white light is intended to represent *shunyata*, the Null state of the *vajra*, and the *bindu* (dot or point). The *bijas* (seeds) emanate out of the point, out of emptiness, and merge back into the same. The female *bindu* and the male *bija* giving birth to the cosmos.

Primary source references consisted of two tomes which were studied over a three month period. [The Encyclopedia of Tibetan Symbols and Motifs](https://www.amazon.com/dp/157062416X/?tag=17171-20) and [The Circle of Bliss: Buddhist Meditational Art](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1932476016/?tag=17171-20). Other secondary sources include: [The Tibetan and Himalayan Library](https://www.thlib.org/) and [Dharma Dictionary](http://rywiki.tsadra.org/).

## Filenames

Each file is named according to the Wylie transliteration of the syllable appended with the file dimensions in inches, e.g., `hU~M-7x5.png` for the HUM 5x7 version.

## Printing

The images in this set have been output at a high resolution (300dpi) which is suitable for printing at convenience store photo centers or on a home printer. Two sizes are provided for each syllable: 5x7in (127mm x 178mm), and 5x5in (127mm x 127mm). The 5x7in size was chosen because it's a common photo frame size available at most stores.

## Special Thanks

I'd like to thank Gerry W. from [Nitartha International](https://nitartha.net/) (creators of the Sambhota Unicode font used in the images) and the staff at [Vimala Treasures](http://vimalatreasures.org/), both of whom helped clarify and validate the *bijas* in the collection.
