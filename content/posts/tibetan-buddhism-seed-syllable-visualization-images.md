## Hidden Symbology

While researching this project, it was fascinating to learn more about the hidden symbolism which appears in Buddhist imagery, specifically the Tibetan Vajrayana and Dzogchen in particular. While the images in this collection appear simple in their design, they are expressing **ancient esoteric teachings encoded into symbols**. Working from the outermost symbol inwards, we have:

**Rays of Light**: Rays of light emanate from the center-point.

**Five Spherical Rings**: On an exoteric level the rainbow-like rings represent the five elements as described in Vajrayana:

- Ether, Space (*Vyoma*, *Akasa*): White, Vairochana, KHAM
- Air (*Vayu*): Green, Amitabha, YAM
- Fire (*Agni*): Red, Akshobhya, RAM
- Water (*Varuna*): Blue, Ratnasambhava, VAM
- Earth (*Prithivi*, or *Bhumi*): Yellow, Amoghasiddhi, LAM

On an esoteric level the rings have a vast interpretation that can consume a lifetime (or more) of study. However, for the images of this collection, two core teachings were implemented: Annutara Yoga Mother class Tantra (Vajrayogini, left-hand tantra) and the Ati Yoga Dzogchen *thigle* (tib: thig le, skrt: bindu).

To understand the way in which the female tantra is symbolized in the images, we must first consider the Pancha (Five) Jina Buddha Mandala. This mandala is one of the primary formulations of the bliss-body (*sambhoga kaya*), and a way to conceptualize Buddhahood in meditation and art.

In the male tantras, this mandala is visualized *clockwise* beginning from the eastern direction (bottom in the mandala). Directionally, this would be East (Blue, Bottom, Akshobhya) -> South (Yellow, Left, Ratnasambhava) -> West (Red, Top, Amitabha) -> North (Green, Amoghasiddhi) -> Zenith (White, Center, Vairochana). However, in the female tantras the eastern and zenith position are switched and one visualizes in a *counter-clockwise* direction beginning at the zenith, hence the name "left-hand". The rings in the images, represent the female tantra version of the Pancha Jina Buddha Mandala.

Switching motifs to the Dzogchen *thigle*, the rings take on another level of meaning which builds upon the previous mandala. The word *thigle* can be translated as "spheres", "drops", or "seminal point". Taken in the context of Dzogchen, the *thigle* references the rainbow body (tib: 'ja' lus) level of realization and the second *Rigpa* wisdom *lhun grub*, or full enlightenment and the self-liberation of the human body into a non-material body of light. The "rainbow body phenomenon" is the third party observation (spheres of rainbow light) of the moment when a practitioner attains the rainbow body (*sambhoga kaya*) at death.

It's important to note (and visualize) the colors starting inside with blue and working outwards to white. We are beginning at the zenith, at emptiness.

**Emptyness** and the **Vajra Midpoint**: The *vajra* (tib: rdo rje) is a symbol like the rings which can consume an entire lifetime (or more) of study. Focusing on Tibetan Buddhism and the esoteric viewpoint, the *vajra* is a symbol of an adamantine state of existence and embodies emptiness (skrt: shunyata). The center of the *vajra* represents the Null state, where *Samsara* emerges, regenerates, and disintegrates. On the left side of the *vajra* is Phenomena, and on the right is Noumena.

In the images, the central burst of white light is intended to represent *Shunyata* and the Null state of the *vajra*. The *bijas* emanate out of this emptiness and recede back into the same. Imagine a *vajra* extending both outwards toward your eyes, and backwards behind the image. In other words, the *vajra* is half in front (Phenomena) and half behind (Noumena) the image, with the Null state and emptiness at the center-point.

## Filenames

Each file is named according to the [Wylie transliteration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wylie_transliteration) of the syllable appended with the file dimensions in inches, e.g., `hU~M-7x5.png` for the HUM 5x7 version.

## Printing

The images in this set have been output at a high resolution (300dpi) which is suitable for printing at convenience store photo centers or on a home printer. Two sizes are provided for each syllable: 5x7in (127mm x 178mm), and 5x5in (127mm x 127mm). The 5x7in size was chosen because it's a common photo frame size available at most stores.

## Special Thanks

I'd like to thank Gerry W. from [Nitartha International](https://nitartha.net/) (creators of the Sambhota Unicode font used in the images) and the staff at [Vimala Treasures](http://vimalatreasures.org/), both of whom helped clarify and validate the *bijas* in the collection.
